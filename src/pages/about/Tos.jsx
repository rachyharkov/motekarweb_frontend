        Below are the terms and conditions that apply to all services provided by Motekar Studio. By using our services, you agree to these terms and conditions. Please read them carefully and contact us if you have any questions or concerns.
      </p>
      <h4 className="text-white bold-title"><span style={{'color': 'var(--color-secondary)'}}>EFFICIENT MEDIA DELIVERY</span></h4>
      <p className="text-white text-justify">
        When it comes to delivering raw media, we've made it easy and convenient for you. Our preferred method for online delivery is through reliable platforms like Dropbox or Google Drive. Simply upload your files and let us take care of the rest. Once we receive your files, we'll promptly notify you of their successful download. If by any chance there are any issues or discrepancies, please reach out to us as soon as possible so we can resolve them promptly.
      </p>
      <h4 className="text-white bold-title"><span style={{'color': 'var(--color-secondary)'}}>UNDERSTANDING YOUR STYLE AND PREFERENCES</span></h4>
      <p className="text-white text-justify">
        To ensure the best outcome for your projects, we need to grasp your unique style and preferences. It's mandatory that you complete your Studio Profile with as much detail as possible. This information will guide our editors in aligning their work with your vision.
      </p>
      <h4 className="text-white bold-title"><span style={{'color': 'var(--color-secondary)'}}>DELIVERY, MEDIA ARCHIVE, RESPONSIVENESS</span></h4>
      <p className="text-white text-justify">
        We will notify you via email for each version of an individual film that is ready for preview. If your account is paid, as per our terms, we will release all assets, including the project file, for your convenience.
      </p>
      <p className="text-white text-justify">
        It is crucial that you maintain complete backups of all media before sending us files online. While Motekar Studio will take care of the files you provide, we are not a media backup service and cannot be held responsible for any loss or damage.
      </p>
      <p className="text-white text-justify">
        During the production process, we reserve the right to request any assets multiple times in order to deliver our service effectively. As the size of raw footage can be substantial, we may delete it once a project is no longer in production. We kindly request that you download all provided project files within 30 days of a film being archived. Please be aware that we will not request your approval or notify you when we remove files. It is your responsibility to regularly check for email communications from Motekar Studio and log in to our website to access your files.
      </p>
      <h4 className="text-white bold-title"><span style={{'color': 'var(--color-secondary)'}}>COPYRIGHT, PRIVACY, AND FEEDBACK</span></h4>
      <p className="text-white text-justify">
        We value the confidentiality of our relationship with your studio. Any information or media shared with Motekar Studio remains strictly confidential and will not be disclosed to any third party without your consent.
      </p>
      <p className="text-white text-justify">
        Please be assured that all footage, completed films, and project files remain the copyright of your studio. Motekar Studio acts solely on behalf of your studio for the post-production process. We do not require any attribution or recognition from you. If we ever wish to use any of your footage or completed works for promotional purposes, we will always seek your permission first.
      </p>
      <p className="text-white text-justify">
        After the approval of each film, you will have the opportunity to review the films and, occasionally, our service as a whole. All feedback provided is confidential but may be shared with our staff members for the purpose of improving our services.
      </p>
      <h4 className="text-white bold-title"><span style={{'color': 'var(--color-secondary)'}}>MODIFYING ORDERS AND CANCELLATION POLICY</span></h4>
      <p className="text-white text-justify">
        At Motekar Studio, we understand that circumstances may change, and you may need to modify or cancel an order. We allow you to upgrade, downgrade, or cancel any film within an order without incurring any penalties or costs, as long as the editing process has not yet begun. If you have already made a payment, we offer a 100% refund for any cancellation request, provided that the editing has not commenced. Once the editing process has started, Motekar Studio reserves the right to withhold any amount up to 100% of the total fee for the canceled item.
      </p>
      <p className="text-white text-justify">
        This cancellation policy applies to all types of orders and requires the refund to be processed through the same payment method and account used for the original transaction. If you wish to cancel a film, project, or order, please contact our team via email at ask@motekarstudio.com.
      </p>
      <h4 className="text-white bold-title"><span style={{'color': 'var(--color-secondary)'}}>EDIT PRIORITY AND ACCOUNT FUNCTIONALITY</span></h4>
      <p className="text-white text-justify">
        If you need to change the editing priority of your projects, please get in touch with our team. However, please note that requesting a change in priority may result in a delay in the expected turnaround times for other projects in the queue.
      </p>
      <p className="text-white text-justify">
        We take the security and privacy of your studio's information on our website login very seriously. While we have conducted comprehensive testing, occasional unexpected errors or miscalculations may still occur. Rest assured that Motekar Studio will promptly resolve any unexpected bugs or issues in the system as required. If you notice any incorrect information, please notify us immediately. We reserve the right to charge additional fees for errors in calculations that result in undercharging for our services.
      </p>
      <h4 className="text-white bold-title"><span style={{'color': 'var(--color-secondary)'}}>TIMELY TURNAROUND</span></h4>
      <p className="text-white text-justify">
        At Motekar Studio, our delivery times, also known as lead times, may vary based on a few factors. As we have a limited number of editors, it's important to plan ahead and secure your spot well in advance of your project dates. We recommend placing your order as soon as you have a retainer from your client and are confident in choosing Motekar Studio for your editing needs.
      </p>
      <p className="text-white text-justify">
        The availability of our editors is the primary factor that determines lead times. Other variables that may affect lead times include the number of projects you wish to order, the projects already in your schedule, and any specific editor requirements you may have.
      </p>
      <p className="text-white text-justify">
        Please note that our estimated delivery dates are not guaranteed. While we strive to meet deadlines, unforeseen circumstances may arise. Motekar Studio cannot be held liable for any costs incurred due to late deliveries. We advise allowing ample time with your clients to accommodate potential delays or the review process between your studio and ours. Prompt and responsive communication is essential to ensuring a smooth workflow.
      </p>
      <h4 className="text-white bold-title"><span style={{'color': 'var(--color-secondary)'}}>CREATIVE FREEDOM AND CONSISTENT</span></h4>
      <p className="text-white text-justify">
        By signing our agreement, you grant us the trust and freedom to edit your films to the best of our ability, closely matching the provided style of work. To further enhance the editing process, please provide specific editing notes for each project in your Studio Profile. This way, we can strive for the most favourable outcome that aligns with your expectations.
      </p>
      <p className="text-white text-justify">
        At Motekar Studio, we aim to assign the most suitable editor to your projects. We'll make every effort to match you with the same editor for consistency, but please understand that their availability may vary. To increase the likelihood of working with your preferred editor consistently, we recommend booking projects well in advance.
      </p>
      <p className="text-white text-justify">
      Music Selection and Licensing Your Studio Profile offers two options for music selection:
      </p>
      <ol className="text-white text-justify">
        <li>Motekar Studio can choose from our extensive MusicBed account.</li>
        <li>You can provide the music per film by uploading it to a Google Drive or Dropbox link</li>
      </ol>
      <p className="text-white text-justify">
        If you request Motekar Studio to select a song for your film, either from MusicBed, your profile, or a provided list, please note that we won't second-guess our song selection. In case you request a change to the songs during the revision process, you must specify a replacement song. If you want us to select a different song for a second time, additional fees will apply.
      </p>
      <p className="text-white text-justify">
        It's important to note that while we provide music, Motekar Studio is not responsible or liable for licensing the music unless it has been sourced through MusicBed. You are responsible for ensuring proper music licensing in your completed films, as required by the laws of your country. Please verify that the MusicBed license we supply is suitable for your distribution and sharing purposes. We will provide the music file, the Musicbed SyncID code, and a PDF of the license agreement for each project that includes music from Musicbed.
      </p>
      <h4 className="text-white bold-title"><span style={{'color': 'var(--color-secondary)'}}>SMOOTH REVISION PROCESS AND PAYMENT TERMS</span></h4>
      <p className="text-white text-justify">
        At Motekar Studio, we have a well-defined revision process, which includes request, approval, delivery, completion, and archiving stages. You can find detailed information about this process on your login account at our website. We will notify you via email whenever a new version of a film is ready for your review. We allow 40 days for you to submit revision requests. If no revisions are requested within this period, the film will be automatically marked as approved/done. Please note that if your studio fails to request revisions within the allowed timeframe, additional fees will apply to reactivate the film.
      </p>
      <p className="text-white text-justify">
        You have the option to reverse a revision request as long as we haven't started editing the requested revisions. Likewise, you can reverse a delivered, completed, or archived film, but charges will apply based on the complexity of your request. For instance, if we need to download footage again or if there is a long list of revisions, a fee in the range of $150+ USD can be expected.
      </p>
      <p className="text-white text-justify">
        Regarding payments, Motekar Studio has a sophisticated payment system that offers various benefits to our clients. We do not require payment at the time of placing an order. We need to review our capacity and confirm the accurate charges before accepting payment. Once a project is scheduled and an estimated delivery date is set, we will display a payment due date. Payment for a project must be made within two weeks of the payment due date. You can rest assured that if you see an estimated delivery date in your account, it means Motekar Studio has accepted the project and secured an editing allotment for it.
      </p>
      <p className="text-white text-justify">
        We accept payments via Payoneer or direct bank transfers to our Motekar Studio bank account. The payment details will be provided through your account on the Motekar Studio website.
